#### BGP
In this packet tracer I created a simple WAN or in other words the "internet".
In our daily life without us being aware there are still routers being configured with BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). By using this protocol our 'Network' expands, so the internet.
#### DNS
By adding DNS server I have shown an example here how the DNS providers actually work.
