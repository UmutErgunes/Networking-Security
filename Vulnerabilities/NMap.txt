While NMAP is running Push:
	C = to show the current step
	P = to show live progress
	d/D = to increase Debugging 


Working:
	nmap [type scan] [options] [target(s)]

Type Scan:
	SYN scan = -sS
	TCP connect scan = -sT
	FIN scan = -sF
	Null scan = -sN
	Ping scan = -sP
	... etc


Type Options: 
	-sV = detailed versions of the ports 
	-A = detailed version of Operation System
	-f = break the packets into piece and send to target, so Firewall will not detect
	-D [Fake Ip] option = to send packets to target like given Fake IP

Type Export: 
	-oN [File_name.txt] = export the file in .txt
	-oX [File_name.xml] = export the file in .xml

Good And Fast Nmap Commands:
nmap -sS -sV -sC -A -f [Target]

Scan all hosts from 2 to 254 and ports in a network:
nmap [IP ex.: 192.168.100].2-254 -vv
